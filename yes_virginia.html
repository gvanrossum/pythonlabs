&gt; A better question might even be: what /is/ Pythonlabs now?  Or /is/
&gt; there a Pythonlabs now?  I dunno -- Guido owns the domain name which
&gt; is probably the biggest claim to Pythonlabhood there is.

Barry, your little friends are wrong.  They have been affected by the
skepticism of a skeptical age.  They do not believe except what they see.
They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little
minds.  All minds, Barry, whether they be men's or children's, are little.
In this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant, in his
intellect as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the
intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.

<p>
Yes, Barry, there is a PythonLabs.

<p>
It exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you
know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy.
Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no PythonLabs!  It would
be as dreary as if there were no Barrys.  There would be no childlike faith
then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence.  We should
have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight.  The external light with which
childhood fills the world would be extinguished.

<p>
Not believe in PythonLabs!  You might as well not believe in fairies.  You
might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the newsgroups to catch
PythonLabs, but even if you did not see PythonLabs post, what would that
prove?  Nobody sees PythonLabs, but that is no sign that there is no
PythonLabs.  The most real things in the world are those that neither
children nor men can see.  Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn?  Of
course not, but that's no proof that they are not there.  Nobody can
conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the
world.

<p>
You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but
there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor
even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived could tear
apart.  Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and
view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond.  Is it all real?  Ah,
Barry, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.

<p>
No PythonLabs?  Thank God it lives and lives forever.  A thousand years from
now, Barry, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, it will continue to make
glad the heart of childhood.
